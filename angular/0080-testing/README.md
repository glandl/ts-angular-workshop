# Testing

## Introduction

This application calculates VAT (German: Mehrwertsteuer) for invoices. A user can enter products and the application calculates and prints the invoice with calculated VAT results.

## Existing Code

The existing code in this application can be started, but it doesn't contain the necessary logic. However, the application contains *Jasmine* unit tests that you can run using `npm test`. Unfortunately, without the logic, most of the tests fail.

## Your Job

Your Job is to analyze the unit tests and add the necessary logic based on the test cases that you could find. The goal is that you become more familiar with *Jasmine* tests.


## Extra Challenge

Looking for an extra challenge? Add at least one additional test that makes sense.

Try to add at least one additional *DOM Test* (see [*app.component.spec.ts*](src/app/app.component.spec.ts)) that makes sense.
